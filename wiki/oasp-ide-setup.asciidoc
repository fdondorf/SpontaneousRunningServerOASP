=== IDE Setup

TODO: This is just the internal draft, needs more explanation.

We are using the link:../../oasp4j-ide[oasp4j-ide] for development. To get started follow these steps:

. Get a Git client. For Windows use:
* http://msysgit.github.io/ (install without explorer integration but with option +Use Git from the Windows Command Prompts+)
* https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/
* https://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/ (for safe storage of your credentials)
. Download the latest +oasp4j-ide-software-\*.zip+ and +oasp4j-ide-scripts-*.zip+ from +\\de-file10\ClientPE\OASP\oasp4j-ide\Releases+ (externals shall consult https://github.com/oasp/oasp4j-ide/wiki[oasp4j-ide])
. Choose a project location for your project (e.g. +C:\projects\oasp+, referred to with +$projectLoc+ in this setup guides following steps). Avoid long paths and white spaces to prevent trouble. Extract the downloaded ZIP files via +Extract Here+ (e.g. using http://www.7-zip.org/[7-Zip]). Do not use the Winodws internal ZIP folder feature to extract as this is not working properly due to long filenames.
. Create a file named +$projectLoc\variables-customized.bat+ in your project location with the following contents: 
+
[source,bash]
-----
set MAIN_BRANCH=main
set SETTINGS_REL_PATH=oasp4j\settings
-----
+
. Clone the git repositories you need to work on into +$projectLoc\workspaces\main+. E.g. open +console.bat+:
+
[source,bash]
-----
cd workspaces/main
git clone https://github.com/oasp/oasp4j.git
git clone https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js.git
-----
+
. Run the script +$projectLoc\update-all-workspaces.bat+.
You should end up having a structure like this in +$projectLoc+
+
* +conf+
* +scripts+
* +software+
* +system+
* +workspaces+
** +main+
*** +oasp4j+
**** +settings+
**** ...
*** +oasp4js+
**** +app+
**** ...
** +readme.txt+
* +console.bat+
* ...
* +variables.bat+
* +variables-customized.bat+
+
. Run the new script +$projectLoc\eclipse-main.bat+ to start the Eclipse IDE.
. *In Eclipse* select +File > Import... > Import existing Maven Project+ and then choose the cloned projects from your workspace.
. In Eclipse +Servers+ view right click on +Tomcat+, select +Add and remove...+ and choose the +oasp4j-sample-server+ project. Then if you start tomcat, you can test the sample application  browsing to +http://localhost:8081/oasp4j-sample-server/security/login+ (see https://github.com/oasp/oasp4j/blob/develop/settings/eclipse/workspace/setup/Servers/Tomcat7-config/tomcat-users.xml[+tomcat-users.xml+] for login credentials). ATTENTION: By default the sample application redirects to +jsclient+ for the oasp4js sample client that is build later in a following step (see below). Until then you will get a 404 (not found) error after that redirect.
. If you want to properly test the example you also need the client from the OASP4JS. Build +oasp4js+ as following: 
.. Run +console.bat+ 
.. Ensure you have a +git+ client on your path:
+
[source,cmd]
-----
git --help
-----
+
If you get an error instead of the git help output, please redo step 1.
.. Now call the following commands:
+
[source,cmd]
-----
cd workspaces/main/oasp4js/
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g bower
npm install
cd java
mvn install
-----
+
.. You can then extract the client from +oasp4js/java/target/oasp4js-sample-*-web.zip+ into +oaps4j-sample-server/src/main/webapp/jsclient+ (restart your tomcat and open http://localhost:8081/oasp4j-sample-server/) or for simpler development run both tomcat and a grunt-server as overlay via:
+
[source,cmd]
-----
cd workspaces/main/oasp4js
gulp serve
-----
